# Cognifyz Data Science Internship Program  
*Where Data Meets Intelligence*  

---

## Introduction  

This repository documents my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**, a leading technology company specializing in **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analytics**.  

The program provided a hands-on opportunity to work on real-world datasets, apply various analytical and machine learning techniques, and deliver impactful insights.  

The internship was structured into **Levels 1, 2, and 3**, each containing tasks that progressively built technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills.

## Tasks
### Level 1

#### Data Exploration & Preprocessing.
- **Identify dataset size (rows, columns).**
- **Handle missing values.**
- **Perform data type conversions.**
- **Analyze target variable distribution ("Aggregate rating").**

#### Descriptive Analysis
- **Compute statistical measures (mean, median, std, etc.).**
- **Explore categorical distributions: Country Code, City, Cuisines.**
- **Identify top cuisines and cities with the highest restaurant counts.**

#### Geospatial Analysis
- **Map restaurant locations using latitude/longitude.**
- **Analyze city/country restaurant distributions.**
- **Correlate location with ratings.**

### Level 2

#### Table Booking & Online Delivery**
- **% of restaurants offering booking/delivery.**
- **Compare ratings: with vs. without booking.**
- **Analyze delivery availability across price ranges.**

#### Price Range Analysis
- **Identify most common price ranges.**
- **Compute average ratings per price range.**
- **Highlight top-performing price ranges by color coding.**

#### Feature Engineering

- **Extract new features (e.g., restaurant name length, address length).**
- **Encode categorical features into binary/ordinal features.**

### Level 3

#### Predictive Modeling
- **Build regression models to predict Aggregate Rating.**
- **Compare algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).**
- **Evaluate models with performance metrics.**

#### Customer Preference Analysis
- **Relationship between cuisine type and ratings.**
- **Identify popular cuisines based on votes.**
- **Highlight cuisines with consistently high ratings.**

#### Data Visualization
- **Visualize rating distributions (histograms, bar plots).**
- **Compare cuisines/cities by average ratings.**
- **Explore feature-target relationships using plots.**
